          <h3>Impact</h3>
          <hr>
          <p> Slippery roads have higher risk of accidents like people slipping, falling or losing control while walking, running or cycling which lead to injuries, especially for children and elderly visitors. It also reduced accessibility for people who are disabilities, strollers or wheelchairs which is hard for them to move safely on slippery surface.</p>

          <h3>Consequences</h3>
          <hr>
          <p> Slippery roads cause accidents, and the risk are increasing.  It became an unsafe environment for visitors especially children, elders and disabled visitors in the rainy seasons. If the road are not safe, there will be less visitor will want to visit the park and cause a negative impact and reputation to the local park.</p>

          <h3>Improvement</h3>
          <hr>
           <p>To improve slippery roads, it would be best to repair or resurface the path by fixing the cracks, holes or uneven areas as soon as possible. It is also possible to improve by applying anti-slip coating to give the surface of the road more grip in frequently used areas by visitors. Other improvement ideas like removing moss and adding warning signs will make the environment better as well.</p>

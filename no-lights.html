          <h3>Impact</h3>
          <hr>
          <p>Lack of lights disturb visitors by limiting visibility, which impacts a sense of safety and increases the difficulty of navigation due to unseen paths and obstacles. Conversely, the absence of artificial light benefits the environment and wildlife by maintaining the natural dark cycle, which is crucial for animal behavior and ecosystem function. </p>

          <h3>Consequences</h3>
          <hr>
          <p>The consequences of no lighting a park at night can be viewed from both human and environmental perspectives. For people, the primary consequences are a potential reduction in park usage after dark, as the limited visibility and diminished sense of safety deter visitors. This can also lead to an increased incidence of accidental injuries from trips and falls due to unseen hazards. Conversely, the environmental consequences are overwhelmingly positive, resulting in the protection of nocturnal wildlife from light pollution, the conservation of energy, and the preservation of the natural night sky for stargazing.</p>

          <h3>Improvement</h3>
          <hr>
          <p>Improving the park’s lighting at night would make it feel a lot safer and more comfortable for everyone.  Solar lights and motion-sensor lamps would brighten up the park without wasting energy. Even small things like glow-in-the-dark markers or low pathway lights can guide visitors and prevent accidents. With regular checks to fix broken bulbs, the park would be way more welcoming, more safely and easier to enjoy after sunset.</p>

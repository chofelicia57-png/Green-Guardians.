          <h3>Consequences</h3>
          <hr>
          <p> Throwing Rubbish in local park causes negative consequences for the environment and the community. Littering pollutes the soil, harms wildlife, and make the park look unclean and unpleasant.  It also creates health risks by attracting pests and increase the chance of injuries due to sharp objects. Fewer people visit the park if the park is unclean and the community will have to spend more money to clean.            </p>

          <p>To improve this issue, it would be best to provide more well-placed bins with clear sorting instruction that is easier to understand such as signboards, and making sure they are emptied regularly. Joining clean-up events will also help maintain the park’s cleanness. </p>

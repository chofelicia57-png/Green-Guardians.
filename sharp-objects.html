          <hr>
          <p>Sharp items in parks pose major threats to humans and animals alike, causing injuries and spreading disease. Broken glass, needles, and metal debris lead to cuts, infections, and habitat contamination. Wildlife also suffers injuries, entanglement, and death from ingestion. This litter degrades public spaces, posing fire hazards and discouraging visitors. The solution lies in responsible waste disposal and immediate removal of hazards to ensure park safety.</p>

          <p>Sharp items in parks pose major threats to humans and animals alike, causing injuries and spreading disease. Broken glass, needles, and metal debris lead to cuts, infections, and habitat contamination. This litter degrades public spaces, posing fire hazards and discouraging visitors. The consequences of this negligence include serious physical harm, the spread of pathogens, environmental degradation, and reduced public access and enjoyment of natural spaces.</p>

          <p> Keeping our park safe from sharp objects starts with smart prevention and regular care. Adding enough secure disposal bins, encouraging visitors to throw items away responsibly, and maintaining consistent clean-up routines all play an important role. Clear signage and easy reporting systems help people know what to do, while anti-littering rules remind everyone to keep the space safe. Together, these improvements create a cleaner, safer park for all visitors and protect the wildlife that lives there.</p>

            <h3>Impact</h3>
            <hr>
            <p> Broken Benches create problems for visitors and the park’s environment. They reduce the comfort and convenience of the park because people, mainly children and elders who visit will not have a safe place to sit and rest.  The park looks neglected when facilities are not very well maintained which discourage people from visiting.</p>

          <h3>Consequences</h3>
          <hr>
          <p> There are many consequences on Broken Benches in local park. For example, Safety Risks, Reduced Comfort, Negative Appearances, Reduced Park Usage and Higher Repair Costs. People can slip, fall or get hurt from sharp edges of wood or unstable parts of the benches. Visitors have fewer places to sit, rest and enjoy the park peacefully. Broken Benches will look poorly maintained which will discourage people from visiting or using the park for activities. The damage increases as if not fixed which make repairing more expensive.</p>

          <hr>
          <p> It would be best to repair or replace broken benches with good new one as soon as one loose screw by using better materials install like using metal or recycled plastic which is long lasting. Having park’s staff inspect benches every month and fix the damage part on the benches will prevent from risks.</p>
